    "In the process of eventually deploying an app to `Heroku`, I've come a long way in terms of organizing my ETL structures. I'm grateful for having spent time learning more about coding in Python. This class is far too expensive, computationally, to run on a remote server. \n",
    "\n",
    "That limitation has forced me to consider alternatives -- and structure my 'business outcomes' in a more readable way. I'm going to go back and create several spectra of class labels; and then compare modelling results for each, such that I can find the households most similar to one another in certain areas -- this process in the end may involve more market basket analysis; fpgrowth; and association rules analysis. I'm figuring it out, albeit slowly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end I hope to be able to provide several core recommendation tables; for each of 3-5 class labels for households in the data. Moreover; to be able to generate those class labels using new data that might become available.\n"

    "\n",
    "For example, if our competitor pricing research found that we should target a specific product in order to vie for market share; **the recommender system below would be able to identify what other products might do well alongside the 'targeted' item in a marketing campaign to that customer. With multiple reasons to come to the store, the customer might be more inclined to make the trip, or to spend more if they do**. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recognize that in a brick-and-mortar store, having live-updating recommendations based on items in basket is not necessarily as useful as it would be in an online shop -- however, I believe there is value to be offered by using a system like this."
